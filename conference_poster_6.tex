The Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS) Project has been supporting researchers in offline digital data capture and management on Android devices since 2014. In 2020 the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and 19 partners invested in us to rebuild the FAIMS Mobile Platform from the ground up. Our new software, FAIMS3, is cross-platform (Android, iOS and desktop), offers more flexible synchronisation, new integrations, a DIY option for customisation, and a sleek new look. As we prepare for its public release in 2023 we present the current set of features, those on the roadmap for future development, and our plans for sustaining this open-source software in a commercial setting.}

\section*{Introduction}

The \textbf{FAIMS Mobile Platform} is open-source software for offline data collection. FAIMS stands for \textbf{Field Acquired Information Management Systems}. The platform was established by archaeologists at UNSW Sydney in \textbf{2012}. It is now based at Macquarie University and used by researchers from many fields in diverse situations. In 2020 the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and 19 partners invested in us to rebuild the FAIMS Mobile Platform from the ground up (ARDC Platforms project doi: 10.47486/PL110). 

In partnership with the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and 19 research and institutional partners, the \textbf{FAIMS 3.0 Project} has been rebuilding the FAIMS Mobile app from the ground up. We are working with developers at Australian Astronomical Optics Macquarie (AAO) to customise our software stack to enable cross-platform data collection (Android, iOS and desktop), more flexible synchronisation, integration with other platforms, a DIY option for customisation, and a sleek new look.

The open-source tool will be released in \textbf{April 2023} under a new name: \textbf{Fieldmark}. From July \textbf{Electronic Field Notebooks Pty Ltd} will commence offering hosting services for Fieldmark.

\section*{Application Design}

FAIMS 3.0 allows teams to create \textbf{custom} mobile applications for \textbf{offline} field data collection--on consumer-grade hardware--without having to write or maintain code.

We use \textbf{React}, \textbf{Capacitor}, and \textbf{PouchDB} to collect, edit and export data--structured, geospatial, instrument, and multimedia data--on Android, iOS, and the web. 



\subsection*{Workflow}
A FAIMS3 data-collection project \textbf{starts with a workflow}, preferably an established one. It may begin in a paper form and companion manual, a well-crafted digital package or an export from a prior project.


The field director (or delegated person) then makes the \textbf{notebook specification} on our (online) \textbf{notebook creator} to suit the data needed. (We don’t support multi-person notebook editing at present, so one and only one person should be responsible for the notebook design.) 

We then \textbf{deploy the notebook on appropriate servers}. The team can deploy FAIMS3 onto several devices through various channels: \textbf{Android}, \textbf{web}, and \textbf{iOS}. As they are deploying devices, the team should also be registering and communicating their usernames (currently through FAIMS3 administrators). (Project leads will eventually manage the deployment of notebooks and management of users themselves.)


Once \textbf{synchronised, data collection can begin.} Users can bring tablets and phones and laptops out into the field to collect data. (Specifically, we support record creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.) We have demonstrated using external Bluetooth GPS receivers and support onboard camera and external file attachments for photos and multimedia. 

%Thus, we have a team, while offline, collecting geospatial and multimedia data in addition to structured data as specified in their workflow.

% \endgroup

 


\textbf{Then, once back from fieldwork, data can be exported.} This export can utilise a variety of formats and APIs.

\subsection*{Architecture}

\captionof{figure}{FAIMS3 Data flow and schematic architecture.}
\end{center}


The FAIMS3 web-app: the app, itself, is written in Javascript (\textbf{NodeJS ← React ← Formik ← Yum, Material UI, OpenLayers, Capacitor, Moustache}). When presented on the browser, the browser receives a static site (HTML + compiled/minified JS + CSS + binary assets). The app uses PouchDB as a local, offline-capable, NoSQL datastore. It reaches out to our server to generate a JWT authentication token.

Our lightweight server, \textbf{the Conductor}, handles role management and authentication. It however, does not perform data exchange. The Conductor mints tokens, will eventually be able to moderate, edit, and create notebook designs, and will handle being a wrapper for our CouchDB datastore for other clients and non-FAIMS3 users.

\textbf{PouchDB} uses the JWT token to replicate with a central \textbf{Apache CouchDB} datastore running in a Docker container. The reason we chose CouchDB/PouchDB was because full replication (copy and sync) running in an `eventual synchronisation' state (i.e. when the database can see the network again) was very exciting to us. We did not have to write an offline-capable data synchronisation protocol.

Once all notebook metadata and data are synchronised, a properly authenticated user can load visible notebooks and visible records. Once this initial sync is performed the app is entirely equipped for offline fieldwork.

\textbf{The FAIMS3 mobile app} is all of the above, except instead of NodeJS, Ionic’s CapacitorJS transpiles the javascript + extra components and plugins into native code for iOS and Android. Pragmatically, it is the same technology used by Electron to wrap a web browser and an extremely specific set of pages in an executable wrapper. As a hybrid native app, however, we can access the device-specific APIs for geolocation, camera, and Bluetooth — functionality critical for arbitrary workflows. Capacitor offers many plugins in this vein.



\columnbreak

\textbf{Roundtrip and Export} scripts are presently written in Python and connect directly to the CouchDB servers. By using our own library, we can translate the form → record → revision → attribute-value-pair NoSQL appropriate format of our internal datastore into dataframes appropriate for manipulation and export. These scripts can create new revisions (changing field values and record metadata like deleted flags) as well as exporting single entries or an entire workflow's datastore. Once in a more computable format, scripts then rename photos and files, organise everything, and export to csv, xlsx, KML, and GeoJSON.

The FAIMS Project has a 10-year record of successful software development, deployment, client support and community-building. 

Drawing on our experience with the CSIRO ON Prime Program (2016), including 70+ interviews with users and potential adopters, we carefully refined our technological priorities to meet user needs. The new system will be self-service, cross-platform and retain the core features of the old software with enhanced performance. 

\subsection*{Commercialisation}

With an open-source core supporting research transparency but value-adding services that can generate revenue to share the cost of long-term maintenance of the software. This is the COSS model.

We have established a company, Electronic Field Notebooks Pty Ltd, which is currently based at the Macquarie Incubator. This program has energised and accelerated our commercialisation plans as we revisit value propositions, customer segments and refine our pitch.

It is clear that in a marketplace of open-source and proprietary tools for research data collection and offline data collection, the specialised needs of researchers collecting field data--of their own design--in offline settings in a fashion that enables FAIR-sharing of their data, compliant with the needs of their institution and funding bodies remains unmet.

\section*{Early adopters}

Our current beta software has been deployed by research and commercial teams for pilot projects at Macquarie University, CSIRO and Aarhus University. We are learning much about the limitations and possibilities of our new architecture.
